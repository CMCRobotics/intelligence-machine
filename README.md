## :gear: How to develop

In order to obtain the latest dev version of dependencies, you may need a Github token.

### üõ†Ô∏è Creating a GitHub Personal Access Token for npm

* Go to GitHub.com and log in to your account.
* Click on your profile picture in the top-right corner and select "Settings".
* In the left sidebar, click on "Developer settings".
* Click on "Personal access tokens" and then "Tokens (classic)".
* Click "Generate new token" and then "Generate new token (classic)".
* Give your token a descriptive name.
    For scopes, select at minimum:
    ```
    read:packages
    ```
    If you also need to publish packages, include:
    ```
    write:packages
    delete:packages
    ```
* Click "Generate token" at the bottom of the page.
* Copy the token immediately - you won't be able to see it again!

You need to export your token as **NPM_AUTH_TOKEN**.
